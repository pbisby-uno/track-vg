A repository for TrackVG COE project

## What is it?
An application to track a videogame collection. You can use it to view, filter and sort your games collection, and track their current status (to play, playing, completed, retired). Later, you can add a rating and playtime information.

## How does it work?
A user can create and log into an account where they can begin to add games to a collection. Username/email address and password initally required to create a skeleton account.
When adding games, to start with the user can input some basic information such as title, genre and platform, later adding more information such as a rating, playtime, notes etc. Games can be categorised according to their current status in your collection (currently playing, completed etc). Users can add to a wishlist of games that they would like to eventually acquire for their collection. A 'stats about your collection' page will display various items such as, number of games owned for each platform, favourite genre, total length of logged playtime, and more.
